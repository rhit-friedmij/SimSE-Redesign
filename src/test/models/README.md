The models in this folder will be used to ensure changes in code generation are correct. The successful generation of these models do not guarantee that all game functionality will still be intact, so additional manual testing of the gameplay is required to ensure code generation was successful.

You will have to change where the icon and destination directories are pointing on your local machine. Map the icon directory path to the simse-redesign\src\test\resources folder and map the destination directory to a folder outside of simse-redesign
